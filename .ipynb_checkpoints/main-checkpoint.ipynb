To find the total revenue for 2023, we can use the percentage change in revenue between 2022 and 2024.\\n\\nThe percentage change in revenue between 2022 and 2024 is 16% ($245,122 million - $198,270 million) / $198,270 million. To find the total revenue for 2023, we can multiply the total revenue for 2022 by (1 + 0.16) or 1.16.\\n\\nTotal revenue for 2023 = $198,270 million x 1.16 = $230,111 million\\n\\nTherefore, the total revenue for Microsoft in 2023 is approximately $230,111 million.\",\n",

      "  \"answer\": \"Based on the provided context, we can determine that Google's revenue for 2023 was $307.4 billion. However, we cannot determine the percentage of Google's revenue that came from cloud in 2023 because the context does not provide the specific revenue figure for Google Cloud in 2023.\\n\\nHowever, we can find the revenue figure for Google Cloud in 2023, which is $33.1 billion. To calculate the percentage of Google's revenue that came from cloud in 2023, we can divide the revenue figure for Google Cloud by the total revenue for 2023 and multiply by 100.\\n\\n($33.1 billion \\u00f7 $307.4 billion) x 100 = 10.8%\\n\\nTherefore, approximately 10.8% of Google's revenue in 2023 came from cloud services.\",\n",
